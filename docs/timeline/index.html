The framework had <abbr title="Remote Method Invocations">RMI</abbr> interfaces defined in XML and spoke some elaborated binary protocol over the wire. To tie it all together I eventually provided some .Net runtime written in C# and a set of involved XSLT transformations to generate the bridge.</p></dd></div><div><dt class="text-xs font-bold text-red-600">2004 to the end of 2006</dt><dd><p>Figured out I'd be better off doing freelance consulting and tackled a wide range of projects for my clients: wrote a fancy GTK UI in Python for a self order payment kiosk provider, implemented a monstrous intranet portal in PHP, developed a non-trivial <abbr title="Virtual File System">VFS</abbr> driver for Windows, and built a full-blown DNS server in C++ from scratch. If it could be <abbr title="A computer hacker is a computer expert who uses their technical knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means.">hacked</abbr>, I'd be onto it. Those were fun times.</p></dd></div><div><dt class="text-xs font-bold text-red-600">February 2003</dt><dd><p>Got hired by a team working on a binary Usenet groups aggregator service. I implemented lots of the backend and frontend mostly in Perl with occasional sprinkles of C: fetching of the news articles and their attachments, combining the multipart attachments, recovering missing parts, generating thumbnail previews for media files, building a sophisticated declarative forms module, etc.</p></dd></div><div><dt class="text-xs font-bold text-red-600">May 15th, 2002</dt><dd><p>The company I was working for was a kind of ISP and they were desperetely in need of a billing solution for their clients, which I ended up developing full-time on top of Linux, iptables, <a href='https://www.caida.org/tools/measurement/netramet/'>NeTraMet</a>, and PostgreSQL. The result even gained me <a href='https://www.soft-parade.ru/node/362'>the 1st Place Award at the Soft-Parade student software contest</a>.</p></dd></div><div><dt class="text-xs font-bold text-red-600">March 2001</dt><dd><p>Lended a web master job at a local advertising agency.

I developed an app to build educational presentations. The UI was close to the Visual Basic suite with all the drag'n'drop mechanics and widgets, and the resulting presentations were serialized into standalone player JARs that could run on both Windows and Linux. The project was awarded <a href='https://www.soft-parade.ru/1999'>the 3rd Place Award at the Soft-Parade student software contest</a>.</p></dd></div><div><dt class="text-xs font-bold text-red-600">Near the end of October 1998</dt><dd><p>Got my first job as a web master.

All of the images were encoded in my own <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding'>RLE</a>-based format and the game sported cool 8-bit tracker soundtrack and effects.</p></dd></div><div><dt class="text-xs font-bold text-red-600">February 1998</dt><dd><p>My uncle gave me my first PC—a 60Mhz Pentium with 4MB RAM and a 512MB HDD—and a HP LaserJet printer. He hadn't given me a monitor though and I was too poor to buy one.

Unfortunately there was no way to connect it to our old Soviet black-and-white Rassvet 307-1 TV set.
