# List of conditions and preferences, for recruiters

<p class="font-light text-xl lg:text-2xl 2xl:text-4xl">Every once in a while recruiters reach out to me with offers and all kinds of opportunities. Most of these make no sense, and with only a little bit of research, they wouldn't have been sent.</p>

Now, I know that research is hard, especially when there are so many places to look for information. So just below, I'll put together a list of conditions, for recruiters:

- I prefer to work remotely.
- I am okay with occasional visits to HQ.
- While I'm willing to travel, I prefer to do that rarely.
- I run macOS as the primary operating system, that's my work environment. I am willing to run other operating systems in VMs and the like for testing purposes, but I'd like to avoid using them as my main development environment.
- If the interview process involves coding at a whiteboard, or brain-teasers, or anything like that, I'm walking out. I'm happy to show my skills in realistic environments, if my public code contributions aren't enough for one reason or another.
- I prefer to work with small agile teams.
- Please do mention the company you're recruiting for, otherwise I have no way of doing my part of the background check.
- The values I consider important must match what the company values, or have a large enough overlap. This is something I'll be the judge of.

There are many more things I consider important, but these are the basic requirements. If you have an opportunity at a company that aligns with all of the above, one that matches my skills and goals (feel free to ask me about those), we can talk.
