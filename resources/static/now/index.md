title: What I'm Up to Now

# What I'm Up to Now[^1]

I live in the beautiful coastal town of Wollongong, NSW, Australia—about 80
kilometers south of Sydney along the coast.

I'm happily married to a wonderful woman, and together we're raising our lovely
kids. When I'm not absorbed in a software project, we spend most of our time
exploring Australia's incredible outdoors.

Since December 2021, I've been working at [Payreq](https://payreq.com/), where I
dive deep into Clojure, AWS, and everything in between.

In my spare time, I love tinkering with Clojure and Emacs while trying to figure
out how to effectively manage information in our digital age. I recently read
[How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.amazon.com.au/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B06WVYW33Y)
by Sönke Ahrens and
[Digital Minimalism](https://www.amazon.com.au/Digital-Minimalism-Living-Better-Technology-ebook/dp/B07D1G6DTF)
by Cal Newport—both books have influenced me tremendously. Eric Evans's
[Domain Driven Design](https://www.amazon.com.au/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215)
is another recent favorite of mine.
