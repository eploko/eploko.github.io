title: What I'm Up to Now

# What I'm Up to Now[^1]

During the last several years I migrated to Australia and have happily settled in the nice coastal town of Corrimal NSW, some 80 kilometers down the coast from Sydney.

I am happily married to a wonderful girl and we are raising a great kid together. If I'm not preoccupied with a software project, we spend a lot of time exploring the exciting outdoors of Australia.

Since March 2021 I work for [Accelo](https://accelo.com/). I still am not sure what this relationship will lead to, but I totally enjoy the folks I work with, the scope of things to apply myself to, and the positive vibe everyone brings to the workplace.

In my spare time, I play a lot with Clojure and Emacs and try to figure out how I can effectively manage the information flow of the digital age. I've recently read [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.amazon.com.au/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B06WVYW33Y) by
SÃ¶nke Ahrens and [Digital Minimalism](https://www.amazon.com.au/Digital-Minimalism-Living-Better-Technology-ebook/dp/B07D1G6DTF) by Cal Newport and the books influenced me heaps.
