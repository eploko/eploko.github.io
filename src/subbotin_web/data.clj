If it could be <abbr title=\"A computer hacker is a computer expert who uses their technical knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means.\">hacked</abbr>, I'd be onto it.

The framework had <abbr title=\"Remote Method Invocations\">RMI</abbr> interfaces defined in XML and spoke some elaborated binary protocol over the wire. To tie it all together I eventually provided some .Net runtime written in C# and a set of involved XSLT transformations to generate the bridge."}])
